# TODOapp
This application allows an admin to open a "room" and to maintain a TODO list, other users can "enter" the room and add tasks to the admin's list. If the task is done, it's moved to the "done" list. If the task can't be done for some reason, it is returned to the user that added the task with the explanation of the reasons the task could not be completed
